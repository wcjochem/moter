#' moter: A package for creating morphological tessellations from building
#' footprint polygons
#'
#' The moter package is designed to explore the morphological tessellation
#' algorithm described by Fleischmann et al. (2020) and implemented in the
#' Python package Momepy \url{https://docs.momepy.org}.
#'
#' Morphological tessellations are an approach to partitioning space based on
#' voronoi polygons created around 2D building footprints. These resulting
#' morphological tessellation polygons approximate a plot scale area and can be
#' used in quantitative study of urban form and morphology.
